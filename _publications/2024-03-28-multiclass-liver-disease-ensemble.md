This paper addresses **multiclass liver disease prediction**, focusing on Hepatitis C and its progression through stages such as fibrosis and cirrhosis. Using the Hepatitis C dataset from the UCI repository, the authors design an **adaptive data preprocessing pipeline** that includes class-specific mean imputation, outlier rejection, log normalization, feature selection, feature scaling, and data balancing.

On top of this, several **ensemble models** are constructed by combining baseline machine learning classifiers. After rigorous hyperparameter optimization, the best model achieves training and testing accuracies of **99.87%** and **99.80%**, respectively, outperforming prior work on this dataset.

A user-friendly interface is also developed, enabling medical professionals to input patient information and receive automated risk assessments for liver disease stages.
