**AutoLumNet** proposes a unified, bi-branch architecture for enhancing both **low-exposure** and **high-exposure** images. One branch focuses on boosting underexposed regions, while the other suppresses overexposed areas, with exposure-aware fusion combining their outputs.

The method is evaluated on custom and public datasets, demonstrating competitive or superior performance to state-of-the-art low-light and exposure-correction models, while maintaining structural consistency and natural color appearance.
