This paper presents a **comparative study** of machine learning and deep learning methods for **mental stress detection** from EEG signals. A traditional **Random Forest** classifier is contrasted with a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** model over carefully preprocessed EEG data.

The analysis highlights the trade-offs between interpretability, computational cost, and accuracy, showing the potential of deep temporal models while emphasizing the importance of robust preprocessing and feature design for stress detection.
