This work explores **auditory evoked potentials (AEP)** as a modality for recognizing **Bengali vowels** from EEG recordings. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained on features derived from AEP signals to classify different vowel stimuli.

The proposed model demonstrates that robust vowel recognition is feasible from non-invasive EEG, contributing to the development of language-specific brain–computer interface systems.
