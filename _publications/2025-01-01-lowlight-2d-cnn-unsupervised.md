This paper proposes an **unsupervised 2D CNN** framework for **low-light image enhancement**, trained on a custom dataset of real-world low-light images. Without paired ground truth, the method relies on self-supervised constraints and image statistics to improve brightness and contrast while preserving structural details.

Experimental results show significant qualitative and quantitative improvements over classical enhancement techniques, validating the effectiveness of the unsupervised CNN design.
