This work introduces **Equivariant Geodesic Networks (EGN)**, a geometry-aware architecture for learning on data that naturally lies on **Riemannian manifolds**, such as covariance matrices. The model is designed to respect the underlying manifold structure through geodesic operations and to maintain equivariance under relevant transformations.

EGN is applied to covariance-based representations in computer vision and signal processing, showing improved stability and performance compared to Euclidean baselines and naive manifold approaches. The framework offers a principled way to integrate manifold geometry into deep learning.
