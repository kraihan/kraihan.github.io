This paper evaluates various **machine learning models** for **brain stroke analysis and prediction**, using clinical and imaging-related features. Several classifiers are compared in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and interpretability for identifying patients at high risk.

The study underscores the potential of ML-based decision support systems in aiding early diagnosis and risk stratification for stroke, complementing traditional clinical assessment.
