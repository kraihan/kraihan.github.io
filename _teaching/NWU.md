Since August 2024, I have been serving as a **Lecturer** in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at **North Western University, Bangladesh**. My teaching responsibilities include delivering lectures, conducting laboratory sessions, designing assignments, and supervising student projects in the following courses:

### Courses Taught

- **Digital Image Processing (EEE-4255)**  
  Delivered lectures on fundamental image processing theory and modern computer vision techniques. Designed lab sessions and assignments focused on practical applications such as filtering, feature extraction, and basic deep learning-based image analysis.

- **Digital Signal Processing (EEE-4135)**  
  Taught core DSP concepts including discrete-time signals and systems, Z-transform, DFT/FFT, and filter design. Emphasized applications in **biomedical signal analysis**, especially EEG and other physiological signals.

- **Sessional on Digital Signal Processing (EEE-4136)**  
  Conducted laboratory sessions introducing students to DSP implementation using MATLAB and Python. Guided student projects on topics such as **EEG signal processing**, noise filtering, and basic feature extraction.

- **Basic Electrical Circuits (EEE-1221)**  
  Taught fundamental concepts of circuit theory, including Ohm’s law, Kirchhoff’s laws, network theorems, and transient analysis. Developed problem sets and tutorials to strengthen students’ analytical skills in circuit analysis.
