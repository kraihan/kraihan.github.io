This project implements a prototype **Smart Classroom Automation and Attendance System**, linked with the paper:

**“Smart Classroom Automation: A Fusion of AI with Voice, Gesture, and Face Recognition Attendance System” (IEEE iCACCESS 2024).**

Key aspects:

- Python + HTML-based app (`app.py`, `templates/`, `static/`) demonstrating:
  - **Face recognition-based attendance** for students.
  - Hooks for **voice and gesture-based control** of classroom functions (e.g., lights, projector, or media).
- Modular structure allowing extension to:
  - Add new biometric modalities  
  - Integrate hardware (IoT, microcontrollers)  
  - Connect to institutional attendance backends

This project showcases your **applied AI work** beyond pure theory: taking ML and CV methods into a **practical, classroom-scale system** aligned with your teaching and education interests.
